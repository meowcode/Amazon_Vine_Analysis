# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to inspect Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

* There were 170 Vine reviews and 37,840 non-Vine reviews.
* 65 Vine reviews were 5 stars and 20,612 non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.
* 38% of Vine reviews were 5 stars and 54% of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.

## Summary

There is no positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program since most of the positive reviews came from non-Vine users. One additional analysis that can be done to support your statement is to check how many verified purchases from Vine users are 5 stars compared to non-Vine verified purchases, this way we will know if the review is from a legitimate purchase.
